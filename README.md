# Microsoft Azure Reference Architectures
## Overview
The aim of this repo is to provide you with a number of reference architectures, starting from the very basic to get started building your solution in Microsoft Azure. Each of theses architectures are built on (although simplified): 

- Zero Trust principles
- Well Architected Framework
- Cloud Adoption Framework

Each includes both bicep 'ready-to-deploy' code, as well as a 'Deploy to Azure' button so you can deploy straight from the reference architecure of your choosing!
