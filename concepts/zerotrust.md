# Zero Trust
## Overview
Zero Trust is a security model assuming breach and verifying each request as though it is coming from an uncontrolled network. 

### Guiding principles
in order to adapt to the complexity of the modern environment, and to protect people/devices/applications/data wherever they are located the Zero Trust security model is the recommended model based on the following guidelines:

- **Verify explicitely**: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
- **Use least privilege access**: Limit user access with Just-in-Time and Just-enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive polices, and data protection.
- **Assume breach**: Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defences.

## Develop apps using Zero Trust principles
Zero Trust is a security framework that does not rely on the implicit trust afforded to interactions behind a secure network perimeter. Instead, it uses the principles of explicit verification, least privileged access, and assuming breach to keep users and data secure while allowing for common scenarios like access to applications from outside the network perimeter.

As a developer, it is essential that you use Zero Trust principles to keep users safe and data secure. App developers can improve app security, minimize the impact of breaches, and ensure that their applications meet their customers' security requirements by adopting Zero Trust principles.
